# CHELSA-Climate-Data-Processing
This repository contains a collection of scripts designed to process climate data from CHELSA (chelsa-climate.org). The scripts facilitate the download, unit conversion, cropping by biome, and merging of raster data for precipitation, min temperature, and max temperature. The processed data can be used for various environmental and climate studies.
